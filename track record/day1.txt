1.can i say hook means which fetches data using a link and reuturns as a usable data
1.what is the concept of the hook , kkep it short and plain , simple language
1.so in simple  terms  hooks are usesd to use state/currnt data of target element without doing anything  which makes code faster ,shorter and better , right? react have severel hooks and each hook has a diifferent usecase , like useState and useEffect aare used to fetch data from the link right ?
1.how many hooks does react have ?
1.list them with what are they used for like to fetch data or to add side-effects etc?

    setSearchTerm(event.target.search.value);
  }; - what does -     event.preventDefault(); - this line is doing here
1. is  useEffect: This hook lets you perform side effects in your components. Side effects could be data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM12. means   This hook sets what will happen ?

1. what is react-router-dom
1.how many types of routing are there ?

3.What is the difference between client-side and server-side routing?
4. which one is to use ?
5. What are some examples of websites that use client-side routing?
2.What are some examples of websites that use server-side routing?
2.if dynamic roting is cliet side routing (doesnot refrreshes on routing thus prides smoothness but takes time in first  load)then which routing does refreshes static or default routing ? and which side routing can we call it ?
1. tll me how we manage rotings on each type of routing? 
3. which routers uses dynamic routing in react ? 
3. which routers uses static  routing in react ? 
2.
so in react / web development there are teo types of routing server side and client side but in general there are three - static , dynamic and default so dont confuse both are different concept used in different fields and they alos share some similarities too?
3. so there is javascript in both sides server side and client side ? server side - server code , client side - dom manipulation ,making requests to hte server , and handle events .. 

On the client side, JavaScript is used to create interactive web pages. It can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle user events (like clicks or key presses), make AJAX requests to the server, and more.

On the server side, JavaScript (specifically Node.js) can be used to build the web server itself. This includes handling HTTP requests and responses, accessing databases, file systems, and more. Server-side JavaScript can also render HTML to be sent to the client.

5.so is in dynamic routing the site the site does not refreshes/relaods  ?
6.does  refce command creates basic react  arrow function for react in react ?
7. is next js is the one of the most demanding technologies nowadays ?
8.is next js is a js framework that is built on top of the react which akes  it the upgraded version of the react and more conveinient
1.what problems does react js has ?

17.how to use useState and useEffect to fecth data ..
18.how to use useState and useEffect to fecth data ..
19.explain useEffect hook
20.so the function defines what the effect is goona be but what does the other argument does ?
21. 
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
} - explain this step by step

22.so the button click sends signal to the setcount then it updates the value but what does the useEffect is doing here ?
23.so the setcount passes the upadated value to hte count ?
24.so first the count state is 0 then when clicked the setcount is called with the argument (count+1) as a value which gets passed to count which signal useState that the state is changed but how does this tells useEffect to re-render there is not any connection?
25.so can i say changing state variables triggers render which causes the useEffect to rerun  ?
26.how React ensures that the UI always stays up-to-date with the latest state.
27.when shou;d we use onchange and when should we use onClick?
28.why we use double classnames ?
29. list api tools for web developers? free ones .. 
3.list api tools for web developers? free ones ..
31.what does .io extension indicates ?
32.
input + submit , usestate ,useeffect , fetch , async , await , object destructuring  - make a demo code , liitle project using all these where i can just type and search anything by typing any topic and clicking the submit button ..
33. explain it step by step 
34.
useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      if (query !== '') {
        const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/search?q=${query}`);
        const data = await response.json();
        setData(data);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [query]); - what does  - [query] - means in this code ?
35.
      {data && <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>}
- what does this means?
